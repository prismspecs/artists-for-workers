The most secure method of leaking sensitive information is via Secure Drop. We do not currently have a Secure Drop node ready.

<p>As an alternative, we suggest the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>register for <a href="https://protonmail.com/">free, encrypted ProtonMail</a></li>
  <li>print any documents you wish to send -- this ensures that no metadata is embedded in a digital file sent to us</li>
  <li>scan or take photos of those documents</li>
  <li>to scrub any additional metadata introduced from a phone camera, etc. send the photo via <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> to a friend</li>
  <li>download the photo that has been sent via Signal</li>
  <li>send the documents to info@artistsforworkers.org</li>
  <li>if you are unable to complete some of these tasks, know that we will scrub the data on our side as well and delete any originals to protect your safety</li>
</ul>
